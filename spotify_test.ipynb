       "        'standard': 'The Chicago drill superstar’s eighth studio album, 2023’s <i>Almost Healed</i>, was devoted to the concept of recovering from trauma—a theme that’s haunted Lil Durk’s music, either implicitly or explicitly, since his emergence in the early 2010s as the most melodically gifted of the genre’s rising stars. Its March 2025 follow-up, <i>Deep Thoughts</i>, was slated for release in October 2024. But that same month, Durk was arrested (along with several affiliates of his record label and collective, Only the Family) in connection to a murder-for-hire case against a rival rapper. The rapper born Durk Banks has maintained his innocence, but was denied bail on the grounds of being a flight risk. If convicted of the charges, the 32-year-old faces life in prison.\\n\\nThis changes the gravity of his long-awaited ninth album, which was delayed four times since the 2024 arrest. But the tracklist of <i>Deep Thoughts</i> seems to reflect a different lifetime, with pre-arrest singles like “Turn Up a Notch” and a suite of lusty ballads like the benny blanco-produced Jhene Aiko duet, “Can’t Hide It.” The resounding pathos of Durk’s work remains—most potently on “Keep on Sippin’,” whose candid bars detail the vicious cycle of addiction. But the stakes have changed, and it’s hard not to wonder what the Lil Durk of the past year might have to get off his chest instead. Still, an offhand line from “They Want to Be You,” a melancholy Future collab about the expectations of fame, hits even harder now: “All the kids rap, they wanna be just like you.”',\n",

I’m the lord of the mosh!” Carson declares to open <i>More Chaos</i>, his fourth album and <i>A Great Chaos</i>’s feverishly anticipated follow-up. If its predecessor cranked the mayhem and distortion to 11, here the 25-year-old rapper/rock star turns the knobs to 12, running vintage ATL trap through the 2025 deep fryer.

The superstar from Vega Baja is responsible for numerous songs that center his homeland, from unofficial national anthems like “Estamos Bien” and “El Apagón” to powerful posse cuts like “ACHO PR” with veteran reggaetón luminaries Arcángel, De La Ghetto, and Ñengo Flow. More recently, he’s been decidedly direct about his passions and concerns, expressed in vivid detail on 2024’s standalone single “Una Velita.” Positioned as his sixth proper studio album, <i>DeBÍ TiRAR MáS FOToS</i> centers Puerto Rico in his work more so than before, celebrating various musical styles within its legacy. \\n\\nWhile 2023’s <i>nadie sabe lo que va a pasar mañana</i> validated his trapero past with a more modern take on the sound he emerged with in the 2010s, this follow-up largely diverges from hip-hop, demonstrating his apparent aversion to repeating himself from album to album. Instead, house music morphs into plena on “EL CLúB,” the latter genre resurfacing later in splendorous fashion on “CAFé CON RON” with Los Pleneros de la Cresta. Befitting its title, “VOY A LLeVARTE PA PR” is set to a sleek reggaetón rhythm for prime-time perreo vibes, as is also the case for “KETU TeCRÉ” and the relatively more rugged “EoO.” A bold salsa statement, “BAILE INoLVIDABLE” pays apparent homage to some seminal Fania releases by Willie Colón and Héctor Lavoe, with traces of the instrumental interplay of “Juanito Alimaña” and an irresistible coda reminiscent to that of “Periódico de Ayer.” Regardless of style, the political and the personal thematically blur throughout the album, a new year’s gloom hanging over “PIToRRO DE COCO” and a metaphorical wound left open after the poignant “TURISTA.”\\n\\nAs before, Bad Bunny remains an excellent and inventive collaborator, linking here primarily with other Puerto Ricans as more than a mere symbolic gesture. Sociopolitically minded indie group Chuwi join for the eclectic and vibrant “WELTiTA,” its members providing melodic vocals that both complement and magnify those of their host. Carolina natives Dei V and Omar Courtz form a formidable trio for the thumping dancehall retrofuturism of “VeLDÁ,” while RaiNao proves an exceedingly worthy duet partner on “PERFuMITO NUEVO.”',\n",

       "        'standard': 'If there were any remaining doubts as to hip-hop’s MVP, consider the decision stamped: Kendrick Lamar officially won 2024. There were whispers that Compton’s finest was working on an album in the wake of his feud with Drake, a once-in-a-generation beef that kept jaws dropped for months. (Perhaps you’ve heard of a little song called “Not Like Us,” an immediate entry into the canon of all-time great diss tracks.) After a sold-out celebration at the Kia Forum, an armful of Grammy nods and streaming records, and the headlining slot at next year’s Super Bowl, Lamar ties up his biggest year yet with a bow with his sixth album, <i>GNX</i>, the most legitimately surprising surprise drop since <i>BEYONCÉ</i> in 2013.\\n\\nNamed for his beloved classic Buick, <i>GNX</i> finds Kendrick wielding a hatchet he’s by no means ready to bury, still channeling this summer’s cranked-to-11 energy. On “wacced out murals,” he’s riding around listening to Anita Baker, plotting on several downfalls: “It used to be fuck that n***a, but now it’s plural/Fuck everybody, that’s on my body.” (Yes, there’s a nod to his Super Bowl drama with Lil Wayne.) If you’ve been holding your breath for Jack Antonoff to link with Mustard, wait no more—the seemingly odd couple share production credits on multiple tracks, the explosive “tv off” among them.\\n\\nStill, K.Dot keeps you guessing: It’s not quite 12 tracks of straight venom over world-conquering West Coast beats. SZA helps cool things down on the Luther Vandross-sampling “luther,” while Lamar snatches back a borrowed title on “heart pt. 6” to remember the early days of TDE: “Grinding with my brothers, it was us against them, no one above us/Bless our hearts.” He cycles through past lives over a flip of 2Pac’s “Made N****z” on “reincarnated” before getting real with his father about war, peace, addiction, and ego death, and on “man at the garden,” he outlines his qualifications for the position of GOAT. Here’s another bullet point to add to that CV: On <i>GNX</i>, Lamar still surprises while giving the people exactly what they want.\\n',\n",

       "        'standard': 'Playboi Carti has hardly been absent in the roughly four years since <i>Whole Lotta Red</i>, appearing alongside the likes of Future, Latto, and Trippie Redd in the interim. Still, that didn’t keep his enormous fanbase from persistently clamoring over the prospect of <i>I AM MUSIC</i>, ultimately released with the truncated title of, simply, <i>MUSIC</i>. Its substantial length seems to acknowledge the wait, opening with a flurry of rage-rap tracks like “POP OUT” and “CRUSH” that herald the raconteur’s welcome arrival. Over its 30-track, 77-minute runtime, his sonics shift between the aggressively blown-out, synth-heavy post-trap he became infamous for and something markedly poppier, yet all of it undeniably within his stylistic range. \\n\\nCarti initially kept his choice of guests close to the vest, as has become custom for high-profile album drops. Yet it would be impossible not to recognize Kendrick Lamar spitting on “GOOD CREDIT,” Future emoting over “TRIM,” or collaborative career mainstay Lil Uzi Vert gliding triumphantly through “TWIN TRIM.” The Weeknd’s prominent feature on “RATHER LIE” makes for perhaps the most overt example of his envelope-pushing here, though appearances by Travis Scott on “PHILLY” and the tag team of Young Thug and Ty Dolla $ign on “WE NEED ALL DA VIBES” make the pivot even more plausible.\\n\\nEven with friends like these, Carti shines brighter on his own, his breathy near-falsetto vocal booming through the escalating video game arpeggios of “I SEEEEEE YOU BABY BOI” and his raspy snarl swerving around the cinematic noise of “COCAINE NOSE.” Not exclusively looking towards the future, there’s an almost nostalgic appreciation for Atlanta’s early 2010s sound evoked on “RADAR,” its beat reminiscent of classic 1017 Brick Squad tapes.\\n',\n",

       "        'standard': \"The 2025 reworking of Ariana Grande’s lightly conceptual seventh album appends six tracks to its predecessor—and, perhaps crucially, a notable do-over. “intro (end of the world) [extended],” the first of the new cuts, starts simply enough as a reprise of the existential lullaby that opens the original album. But its longing is cut off at the knees when Grande begins describing her desire to “jump into your skin and change your eyes” so she can provide a kind of turbo-charged empathy that reveals the relationship’s darker side. While its pillow-soft sonics and Grande’s resolute singing are gentle, it’s still a jarring lyric to hear right after the album proper’s closer, “ordinary things,” on which Grande's nonna Marjorie tells her granddaughter in no uncertain terms about the signals that a relationship is over. Nonna spoke, Grande listened, that book is closed.\\n\\nOr is there even a book in the first place? When discussing the beat-forward, hit-packed <i>eternal sunshine</i> with Apple Music’s Zane Lowe around its initial release in 2024, Grande said, “Finding a home in <i>eternal sunshine</i> was a lovely costume to wear,” noting that the “freedom within art” was present because of the endless possibilities for sources—personal truths, films (like <i>Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind</i>, the surrealistic love story  that provides the album’s title), high concepts. With the release of <i>Wicked</i>, Ariana's big-screen coming-out party in late 2024, Grande had reached new heights of celebrity—and with that newfound status, her personal life was under further scrutiny.\\n\\nOver the rest of <i>brighter days ahead</i>, Grande is playfully opaque, making a reference to “holding space” on the simmering “warm,” which turns Grande’s vocals into a neon-lit cloud settling over glossy synth skyscrapers, and declaring “I’m still the same but only entirely different” on “Hampstead,” a reimagining of the barroom-piano-led last-call lament. That’s only one spot where Grande’s voice pushes into exciting new territory: “dandelion,” a lusty expression of desire, spins out of a drowsy trumpet line, its looped horn and sampled trap drums adding heat.\\n\\n“Might fuck around and elevate my expectations,” Ariana muses on the chorus of “past life,” a low-lit synth-R&B cut. As with her other releases, <i>brighter days ahead</i> shows how her attention to detail and desire to evolve have resulted in a singular body of work that, even if it’s playing coy about where the public Grande ends and the private Ari begins, is utterly her own.\",\n",

       "        'standard': 'Canadian multi-hyphenate Tate McRae has barely stopped to take a breath since kindergarten: The 21-year-old began intensive dance training at age six, scored a record deal at 16, and tied for top nominee for the 2025 JUNO Awards. Her third studio album arrives just a few months after the end of her 2024 world tour in support of her sophomore album, 2023’s <i>THINK LATER</i>. “Being on tour for a year feels like a million years—you’re like, ‘Holy shit, I have been gone for a lifetime,’” McRae tells Apple Music, though naturally she used the time as a learning opportunity. “Being onstage every night and analyzing yourself that much, you become uber-aware of yourself and what’s going on.” She began paying closer attention to exactly what kind of songs inspired her to move, what beats triggered her dancers to get—in a word—“nasty.”\\n\\n<i>So Close to What</i> is not exactly a club record—more like a pop record you can viscerally feel, conducive to the kind of choreo that makes a killer stage show. Prominent on McRae’s mood board were Timbaland and The Neptunes, whose kinetic productions made the aughts feel like the future. Echoes of sparkly, club-friendly 2000s R&B abound: “bloodonmyhands” recruits Flo Milli for a Miami bass throwback, while “Purple lace bra” lands somewhere between The-Dream’s <i>Love vs. Money</i> and Lana Del Rey’s <i>Born to Die</i> (which checks out, given the latter album’s producer, Emile Haynie, among the credits). And on “Sports car,” McRae and co-writer Julia Michaels found unlikely inspiration in a 2005 crunk classic. “[Michaels] had been dying to reference the Ying Yang Twins’ ‘The Whisper Song,’ and I was like, ‘That’s crazy,’” she says. Sure enough, the concept worked.\\n\\nThe secret to writing her most grown-up album to date, as McRae explains, was a writer’s room that skewed heavily towards women (including Michaels and songwriter Amy Allen). “With music and finding perspective on situations, no one quite understands like another girl,” McRae explains. “You need another girl to know exactly what we’ve gone through and to know what it actually feels like in order to write a song. When you’re in a writing session, you have to be one brain together, and if it’s not that, that’s when chaos happens,” she went on. “It is so liberating to be with other girls and talk about things that are so frustrating and then feel so satisfied and accomplished after.”',\n",

       "        'standard': '“That is who Lady Gaga is to me,” Lady Gaga tells Apple Music’s Zane Lowe of creating <i>MAYHEM</i>. “Maybe to someone else, it might be the Meat Dress or something that I did that they remember as me. But for me, I always want to be remembered for being a real artist and someone that cares so much.” In that vein, Gaga set out to make her latest album—which she calls her “favorite record in a long time”—its own thing. “<i>ARTPOP</i> was a vibe. <i>Joanne</i> was a sound. <i>Chromatica</i> had a sound. All different. <i>The Fame Monster</i> was more chaotic. <i>The Fame</i> was theatrical pop. <i>Born This Way</i>, to me, had more of a metal/electro New York vibe to it,” she says. “I actually made the effort making <i>MAYHEM</i> to not do that and not try to give my music an outfit, but instead to allow myself to be influenced by everything.”\\n\\nIndeed, <i>MAYHEM</i> traverses—and oftentimes melds—the various flavors of Mother Monster’s career, from the disco scene of her earliest work to her singer-songwriter era and back again. The opening tracks, singles “Disease” and “Abracadabra,” revisit dance-floor Gaga to thrilling fanfare. The spirited “Garden of Eden” follows the trend of what she calls “2000 throwbacks.” With its sparkly synths, “LoveDrug” might be seen as the brighter and shinier elder sibling of her early cut “LoveGame.” She even specifically admits the “electro-grunge influence” seeps its way in—especially apparent in “Perfect Celebrity,” “Vanish into You,” and “The Beast.” The latter even shows shades of <i>Joanne</i>, but “Blade of Grass” and her Bruno Mars duet “Die with a Smile” really put her former folk-pop-rock persona on display.\\n\\nIt’s also all incredibly personal to her. “The album is a series of gothic dreams,” she says. “I say it’s like images of the past that haunt me, and they somehow find their way into who I am today.” Below, Gaga takes us through several tracks (all in Spatial Audio), in her own words.\\n\\n<b>“Abracadabra”</b>\\n“I think I didn’t want to make this kind of music for a long time, even though I had it in me. And I think ‘Abracadabra’ is very much my sound—something that I honed in [on] after many years, and I wanted to do it again. I felt like being stagnant was just death in my artistry. And I just really wanted to constantly be a student. Not just reinvent myself, but learn something new with every record. And that wasn’t always what people wanted from me, but that’s what I wanted from me. And it’s the thing that I’m the most probably proud of, if I look back on my career, is I know how much I grew from record to record and how authentic it all was. The thing that was most important to me was being a student of music, above everything else.”\\n\\n<b>“Perfect Celebrity”</b>\\n“It’s super angry: ‘I’ve become a notorious being/Find my clone, she’s asleep on the ceiling.’ It’s almost comical, this idea that any time I’m in the room with anyone, there’s me—Stefani—and Lady Gaga asleep on the ceiling, and I have to figure out which body to be in. It’s kind of intense, but that song, that was an important song on this album because it didn’t feel honest to me on <i>MAYHEM</i> to exclude something that had that kind of anger in it because then it felt like I was trying to be a good girl or whatever and be something that I’m not actually. Part of my personal mayhem is that I have joy and celebration, but I’m also sometimes angry or super sad or really celebratory or completely insecure and have no confidence.”\\n\\n<b>“Shadow of a Man”</b>\\n“That song is so much a response to my career and what it always felt like to be the only girl in the room a lot of the time. And to always be standing in the shadow of a man because there were so many around me that I learned how to dance in that shadow.”\\n\\n<b>“The Beast”</b>\\n“In that record, it is me or someone singing to their lover who’s a werewolf, but what I believe about this is, this record is also about [my fiancé] Michael [Polansky] and I, and that this song is also about me and being Lady Gaga. What the beast is, who I become when I’m onstage, and who I am when I make my art and the prechorus of that song is, ‘You can’t hide who you are. 11:59, your heart’s racing, you’re growling, and we both know why.’ It’s like somebody that is saying to the beast, ‘I know you’re a monster, but I can handle you, and I love you.’”\\n\\n<b>“Blade of Grass”</b>\\n“Michael asked me how I would want him to propose to me one day. We were in our backyard, and I said, ‘Just take a blade of grass and wrap it around my finger,’ and then I wrote ‘Blade of Grass’ because I remembered the way his face looked, and I remembered the grass in the backyard, and I remember thinking he should use that really long grass that’s in the center of the backyard. Those moments, to me, at a certain point I was into the idea of fame and artifice and being the conductor of your own life when it came to your own inner sense of fame. I had to fight a lot harder to make music and dance a little bit later into my career because my life became so different that I didn’t have as much life around me to inspire me.”',\n",

       "        'standard': 'In recent years Evan Felker has transcended his role as the Turnpike Troubadours lead vocalist, representing for his legion of fans something more like a saint than a singer. Since he found sobriety after time off from music in the early 2020s, Felker and his redemption arc have influenced and inspired a number of today’s biggest and brightest country up-and-comers, including Zach Bryan, who wrote a song, 2019’s “Felker,” about the enigmatic musician and references the band in fan favorite “East Side of Sorrow.” \\n\\nThat this follow-up to 2023’s <i>A Cat in the Rain</i> arrives after just two years is a welcome development given the drought of new Turnpike music between 2017 and 2023, and the relatively short period between LPs also, fortunately, does not point to hasty writing or half-assed recording. Instead, Felker and company sound invigorated as ever, with producer Shooter Jennings returning to lend his light but capable touch to 11 new tunes. <i>The Price of Admission</i> opens with “On the Red River,” a vivid and contemplative co-write with Old Crow Medicine Show lead singer Ketch Secor. John Fulbright lends his pen to “Searching for a Light,” a fiddle-heavy exploration of redemption. Other highlights include “Be Here,” an old-timey jaunt complete with gang vocals, and “Leaving Town (Woody Guthrie Festival),” a road song with a heavy dose of reflection.\\n',\n",

       "        'standard': \"Justin Vernon has never been shy about bearing the weight of his instantly mythical origin story and his fast, unlikely trajectory into global stardom. Four albums and 18 years after <i>For Emma, Forever Ago</i>, <i>SABLE, fABLE</i> is a document of finding peace—joy, even—and a testament to the work it’s taken to get there. “This record, as much as that first record, if not more, was really just a keystone for healing and growing away from this time period where I felt trapped,” he tells Apple Music’s Zane Lowe. Once COVID wiped out the tour plans for 2019’s <i>i,i</i>, Vernon, like pretty much everyone, used the time to take stock, and he came to understand, among other things, that touring might not be the healthiest thing for him. So he made songs.\\n\\n“It really was like, ‘Okay, I’m not well and I won't make it if I don't do something to change this pretty drastically and stop the whole touring engine,” Vernon says. “There was a sense of relief and an incredible grief to say goodbye to the team that we built. I was like, ‘Let me just get these songs done and just sneak them out there so I can just get them off my chest,’ because that’s what I really needed: to finish them, to learn what was inside them.” The first of these songs, written at the beginning of lockdown, “THINGS BEHIND THINGS BEHIND THINGS” is a snapshot of that lonely, uncertain time, but it feels bigger and more hopeful than that to Vernon with five years of hindsight. “In the short term, it makes you feel better, but it’s also a way to lean into your grief and lean into your pain and lean into your guilt,” he says. “I think eventually when I hear that song now, I feel clean from everything that I was dealing with when I had to write it and after I wrote it. But it takes years for things to take shape and for internal things to budge.”\\n\\nFrom there, the album begins to let more light in with songs like the evidently more hopeful “Everything Is Peaceful Love” (“It’s just all about celebrating this moment right here and just sort of trying to express that heart-leaping-out-of-your-chest feeling”) and “If Only I Could Wait,” featuring vocals from Danielle Haim of HAIM, which Vernon considers nothing less than his favorite American rock band. The album splits the difference between the immediacy of <i>For Emma</i> and the often inscrutable maximalism of <i>22, A Million</i> and <i>i,i</i>. It was during the album’s long gestation that Vernon’s profile was boosted by his work with Taylor Swift, even as his own project remained in the shadows, Vernon exercising a patience and restraint and creating a healthier perspective that was nothing less than career-saving, if not life-saving. \\n\\n“We are insanely beautiful creatures,” he says. “And so I think where I’ve got to with the simplicity of this music, it was just like, I just want to give it to you. I just want to have it be my version of Bob Seger’s ‘Against the Wind’—just boom, here it is. We’re not going to hide, we’re not going to put it behind any drapery. We’re going to just give it to you as much as humanly possible.”\\n\",\n",

       "        'standard': 'The fourth album from Selena Gomez—the 32-year-old multi-hyphenate who needs no introduction, having been famous for approximately two-thirds of her life—doubles as her first album with her fiancé, benny blanco, who has produced and written more hit singles than you’ve had hot dinners. (It’s blanco’s third album, following 2018’s feature-happy <i>Friends Keep Secrets</i> and its 2021 sequel.) The 14-track collaboration, which the pair announced shortly after their late-2024 engagement, seemed to come together much like their relationship—comfortably, without being planned or forced. “This was just an idea that started in our bedroom—like, ‘Let’s just make something fun,’” blanco tells Apple Music’s Zane Lowe, describing the ease with which the songs unfolded, often collaborating with songwriters (Julia Michaels, Justin Tranter) whose relationships with both Gomez and blanco went back years. “Everything felt right. It almost felt too good.”\\n\\nWritten and recorded mostly at blanco’s house, <i>I Said I Love You First</i> shows the power couple’s love story through a wide-angle lens, zooming out to include past heartbreaks, mistakes, and self-doubts. On “Younger and Hotter Than Me,” Gomez strikes a Lana-esque chord between vulnerable and withering, sniping gently at an old fling: “We’re not getting any younger/But your girlfriends seem to.” Meanwhile, blanco sets the tone at “dynamically moody” with ’80s synth-pop beats ideal for crying on the dance floor, or for highlighting Gomez’s legacy as one of modern pop’s iconic Sad Girls. Here, she sings in Spanish on the slow-burning “Ojos Tristes,” leaves ill-considered voicemails with Gracie Abrams on “Call Me When You Break Up,” and pulls off a respectfully bratty Charli xcx impression on “Bluest Flame.” Potential sappiness is countered by tongue-in-cheek humor: On the entendre-heavy “Sunset Blvd,” the couple embrace naked on a Hollywood street while concerned bystanders call the police. “This whole experience has been cathartic and beautiful,” Gomez says. “And I got to do it with my best friend.”',\n",

       "        'standard': 'In the 18 months after Taylor Swift released <i>Midnights</i>, it often felt as though the universe had fully opened up to her. The Eras Tour was breaking records and blowing past the billion-dollar mark; its attendant concert film became the highest-grossing of all time. She generated interest and commerce and headlines everywhere she stepped foot, from tour stops to the tunnels of NFL stadiums. In 2023, she was named both <i>TIME</i> magazine’s Person of the Year and—just as iconic, tbh—Apple Music’s Artist of the Year. \\n\\nBut do songs about that level of success speak to you? As the news broke that her highly private six-year relationship to Joe Alwyn had ended, Swifties started Swiftie-ing, quickly recirculating a clip on social media of Swift a few weeks earlier, onstage during an early Eras show, in tears as she sang “champagne problems”—a song she and Alwyn had written together. It was a reminder that, despite the superhero-like aura she now radiates, Swift, at her peak, still hurts like the rest of us. What sets her apart is her ability to sublimate that pain into pop. When she announced her 11th studio album in early 2024—while accepting another Grammy, as one does—we probably shouldn’t have been surprised. \\n\\n“I needed to make it,” she’d say of <i>THE TORTURED POETS DEPARTMENT</i> a few weeks later, to a crowd of—[rubs eyes]—96,000 in Melbourne, Australia. “I’ve never had an album where I’ve needed songwriting more than I needed it on <i>TORTURED POETS</i>.” Working again with trusted collaborators Jack Antonoff and Aaron Dessner, she returns to the soft, comfortable, bed-like sonics of <i>Midnights</i>. But the stakes feel noticeably higher here: This isn’t so much a breakup album as it is a deep-sea exploration of everything Swift has been feeling, a plunge through emotional debris. \\n\\nOn “But Daddy I Love Him”—over strings and guitar that faintly recall her country roots—she lashes out at the crush of scrutiny and expectation she’s been subject to from the start. Naturally, catharsis comes after the chorus: “I’ll tell you something right now,” she sings. “I’d rather burn my whole life down than listen to one more second of all this bitching and moaning.” On “Florida!!!” she and Florence + the Machine team up for a pulpy escape fantasy wherein they Thelma and Louise their way down to the Sunshine State in hopes of starting over with new lives and identities: “Love left me like this,” they sing. “And I don’t want to exist.”\\n\\nAt turns hilarious and heartbreaking, <i>TTPD</i> is a study in extremes, Swift leaning into heightened emotions with heightened, hyperbolic, ALL-CAPS language and imagery—how we think when we’re drunk on love or flattened by its sudden disappearance. Note the dark humor she weaves through the Post Malone-enriched opener “Fortnight” (“Your wife waters flowers/I wanna kill her”). Or the thrilling self-deprecation of “Down Bad,” a foray into science fiction wherein Swift likens the warmth of a relationship to being abducted by love-bombing extraterrestrials—only to be left “naked and alone, in a field in my same old town.” \\n\\nBut this remains her most candid and unsparing work to date: As a listener, you frequently get the feeling that you’ve stumbled across emails she’d written but never sent, or into conversations you were never meant to hear. There’s a density and a specificity and a ferocity to her lyrical work here that makes 2012’s “All Too Well” feel sorta light by comparison. If you’re the kind of Swiftie who likes to live in the details, well, this one might be your Super Bowl. “You swore that you loved me, but where were the clues?” she asks on the devastating “So Long, London,” a high point. “I died on the altar waiting for the proof.” Alone at a piano on the haunting “loml,” she flips the script on someone who’d told her she was the love of their life, by telling them that they were the loss of hers: “I’ll still see it until I die.” \\n\\nThe story, as you likely know, doesn’t end there. We get a glimpse of new beginnings in “The Alchemy” (“This happens once every few lifetimes/These chemicals hit me like white wine”) and something like triumph in the montage-ready synths of “I Can Do It With a Broken Heart,” when Swift, shattered on the floor, “as the crowd was chanting, ‘More!’,” still finds the strength to deliver: “’Cause I’m a real tough kid and I can handle my shit.” \\n\\nBut we also get a sense of acceptance, of newfound perspective. On “Clara Bow”—named after a 1920s movie star who was able to survive the jump from silent film to sound—Swift reflects on the journey of a small-town girl made good, sung from the vantage of an industry obsessed with the next big thing. She zooms out and out and out until, in the album’s closing seconds, she’s singing about herself in the third person, in past tense, acknowledging that nothing is forever. “You look like Taylor Swift in this light, we’re loving it,” she sings. “You’ve got edge she never did/The future’s bright, dazzling.”\\n',\n",

       "        'standard': 'Prior to his poppy pivot on last year’s oft personal <i>Sol María</i>, Eladio Carrión thrived as a trapero. A run of mixtape-style projects like 2020’s <i>Sauce Boyz</i> and two feature-free <i>SEN2 KBRN</i> installments advanced the Puerto Rican rapper’s career from underground stardom to a pivotal part of a contemporary vanguard. That peaked in 2023 with the release of <i>3MEN2 KBRN</i>, a bold and boastful album that paired the bilingual artist with Future, 50 Cent, and Quavo without losing his foothold in Latin hip-hop. That uncompromising spirit and deep love for rap music persists on <i>DON KBRN</i>, less a return-to-form post-<i>Sol María</i> than a full-throated statement of dedication to the proverbial culture.\\n\\nAs a lyricist, Carrión has reached a stage in his rap craft that surpasses both peers and veterans alike. This quickly becomes clear after the brief yet potent intro “Invencible” gives way to the stunning “Ohtani,” the first of several solo moments where his powers rightfully surge under the spotlight. With its Hypnotize Minds flair and references to everything from Samuel L. Jackson’s <i>Snakes on a Plane</i> to star running back Saquon Barkley, “H.I.M.” succinctly sums up his highly stylized braggadocio. It certainly doesn’t hurt that he continues to work with great producers who’ve grown with him, the Foreign Teck tags on cuts like “AMG” and “Piedras en la ventana” feeling like a victory for the whole team.\\n\\nCarrión’s guest list is nothing short of a flex in and of itself, freely crossing borders via jet-setting collaborations with North American hitmakers like Big Sean and Jessie Reyez as well as respected Latin artists including Neutro Shorty, Quevedo, and Young Miko. A hospitably inclusive host, he brings música mexicana powerhouse Peso Pluma into the trap space on the brassy “Tiffany” and taps breakout Chilean upstart Cris MJ for the perreo thump of “El Reggaeton del Disco.” Still, when he locks in with the like-minded Myke Towers for the explosive “Vetements,” the fan-friendly team-up’s bars will leave more than a few jaws on the floor. And while the focus is almost exclusively centered on the global rap world, he finds room here for his relatively newfound pop appeal, notably on the duet “Me Muero” with Barcelona’s versatile Lia Kali.',\n",

       "        'standard': 'Kevin Gates dropped <i>I’m Him</i> some five years after “I Don’t Get Tired,” the breakout hit that transformed him from mixtape upstart to mainstream rap rule-breaker. Beyond the controversies and improprieties that added a tabloid-ready gloss to his career, the Baton Rouge artist stood out on that second proper album for his inventive, oft-energetic takes on the trap era’s street-hustle mindset. Now, another half-decade later, freshly independent and pushing 40, he reveals both the rewards and the toll of that lifestyle on this concise sequel. \\n\\nIn line with hip-hop’s ongoing mental health journey in rhyme, opener “Therapy Sessions” dives deep into a psyche so fraught with trauma that it would send most so-called pain rappers into hiding. “Same Way” finds him operating as a master of that particular subgenre, calculating loss amid the wins as a form of cautionary tale for the listener. Via the duality of “Big Bruddah (Don’t Be Mad),” he recounts betrayals and slights endured in the trenches while also flaunting his wealth and the intricate means through which he’s acquired it. Still, he can’t help but come off as triumphant on “Brasi the Eagle,” evoking his infamous mobster moniker to emphasize that his successes surpass his suffering.\\n\\nGates’ characteristically unfiltered approach serves him well here. Whether truth-telling on the grimy motivational “Manifest” or casually pulling the baddest of baddies on the explicit “No Pressure,” that outlandish streak resurfaces enough times that it rewards his day-one listenership. Those long-term fans know that he’s remained true to form all these years, though anyone needing a reminder can reference “Block Away” and “Kiss the Ring” for clarity.',\n",

       "        'standard': \"Billie Eilish has always delighted in subverting expectations, but <i>HIT ME HARD AND SOFT</i> still, somehow, lands like a meteor. “This is the most ‘me’ thing I’ve ever made,” she tells Apple Music’s Zane Lowe. “And purely me—not a character.” An especially wide-ranging and transportive project, even for her, it’s brimming with the guts and theatricality of an artist who has the world at her feet—and knows it. In a tight 45 minutes, Eilish does as she promises and hits listeners with a mix of scorching send-ups, trance excursions, and a stomping tribute to queer pleasure, alongside more soft-edged cuts like teary breakup ballads and jaunts into lounge-y jazz. But the project never feels zigzaggy thanks to, well, the Billie Eilish of it all: her glassy vocals, her knowing lyrics, her unique ability to make softness sound so huge. \\n\\n<i>HIT ME</i> is Eilish’s third album and, like the two previous ones, was recorded with her brother and longtime creative partner FINNEAS. In conceptualizing it, the award-winning songwriting duo were intent on creating the sort of album that makes listeners feel like they’ve been dropped into an alternate universe. As it happens, this universe has several of the same hallmarks as the one she famously drew up on her history-making debut, 2019’s <i>WHEN WE ALL FALL ASLEEP, WHERE DO WE GO?</i>. In many ways, this project feels more like that album’s sequel than 2021’s jazzy <i>Happier Than Ever</i>, which Eilish has said was recorded during a confusing, depressive pandemic haze. In the three years since, she has tried to return to herself—to go outside, hang out with friends, and talk more openly about sex and identity, all things that make her feel authentic and, for lack of a better word, normal. \\n\\n“As much as <i>Happier Than Ever</i> was coming from this place of, like, 'We're so good. This sounds so good,' it was also not knowing at all who I was,’” she tells Apple Music. FINNEAS agrees, calling it their “identity crisis album.” But <I>HIT ME HARD AND SOFT</I> is, she says, the reverse. “The whole time we were making it, we were like, 'I don't know if I'm making anything good, this might be terrible…’ But now I'm like, 'Yeah, but I'm comfortable in who I am now.' I feel like I know who I am now.” \\n\\nAs a songwriter, Eilish is still in touch with her vulnerabilities, but at 22, with a garage full of Grammys and Oscars, they aren’t as heavy. These days it’s heartache, not her own insecurities, that keeps her up at night, and the songs are juicier for it. “LUNCH,” a racy, bass-heavy banger that can’t help but hog the spotlight, finds Eilish crushing so hard on a woman that she compares the hook-up to a meal. “I’ve said it all before, but I’ll say it again/I’m interested in more than just being your friend,” she sings. The lyrics are so much more than lewd flirtations. They’re also a way of stepping back into the spotlight—older, wiser, more fully herself. Read below as Eilish and FINNEAS share the inside story behind a few standout songs. \\n\\n<b>“LUNCH”</b>\\nBILLIE: “One of the verses was written after a conversation I had with a friend and they were telling me about this complete animal magnetism they were feeling. And I was like, ‘Ooh, I'm going to pretend to be them for a second and just write...and I’m gonna throw some jokes in there.’ We took ourselves a little too seriously on <i>Happier Than Ever</i>. When you start to embrace cringe, you're so much happier. You have so much more fun.” \\n\\n<b>“BIRDS OF A FEATHER”</b> \\nBILLIE: “This song has that ending where I just keep going—it’s the highest I've ever belted in my life. I was alone in the dark, thinking, ‘You know what? I'm going to try something.’ And I literally just kept going higher and higher. This is a girl who could not belt until I was literally 18. I couldn't physically do it. So I'm so proud of that. I remember coming home and being like, ‘Mom! Listen!’” \\n\\n<b>“WILDFLOWER”</b> \\nBILLIE: “To me, [the message here is] I'm not asking for reassurance. I am 100% confident that you love me. That's not the problem. The problem is this thing that I can't shake. It’s a girl code song. It's about breaking girl code, which is one of the most challenging places. And it isn’t about cheating. It isn’t about anything even bad. It was just something I couldn’t get out of my head. And in some ways, this song helped me understand what I was feeling, like, ‘Oh, maybe this is actually affecting me more than I thought.’ I love this song for so many reasons. It's so tortured and overthinky.” \\n\\n<b>“THE GREATEST”</b>\\nBILLIE: “To us, this is the heart of the album. It completes the whole thing. Making it was sort of a turning point. Everything went pretty well after that. It kind of woke us back up.” \\nFINNEAS: “When you realize you're willing to go somewhere that someone else isn't, it's so devastating. And everybody has been in some dynamic in their life or their relationship like that. When you realize that you'd sacrifice and wear yourself out and compromise all these things, but the person you're in love with won’t make those sacrifices, or isn’t in that area? To me, that's what that song is about. It's like, you don't even want to know how lonely this is.” \\n\\n<b>“L’AMOUR DE MA VIE”</b>\\nFINNEAS: “The album is all about Billie. It's not a narrative album about a fictional character. But we have always loved songs within songs within songs. Here, you've just listened to Billie sound so heartbroken in ‘THE GREATEST,’ and then she sings this song that's like the antibody to that. It’s like, ‘You know what? Fuck you anyway.’ And then she goes to the club.” \\n\\n<b>“BLUE”</b>\\n“The first quarter of ‘BLUE’ is a song Finneas and I made when I was 14 called ‘True Blue.’ We played it at little clubs before I had anything out, and never [released it] because we aged out of it. Years went by. Then, for a time, the second album was going to include one additional song called ‘Born Blue.’ It was totally different, and it didn’t make the cut. We never thought about it again. Then, in 2022, I was doing my laundry and found out ‘True Blue’ had been leaked. At first I was like ‘Oh god, they fucking stole my shit again,’ but then I couldn't stop listening. I went on YouTube and typed ‘Billie Eilish True Blue’ to find all the rips of it, because I didn't even have the original. Then it hit us, like, ‘Ooh, you know what'd be cool? What if we took both of these old songs, resurrected them, and made them into one?’ The string motif is the melody from the bridge of ‘THE GREATEST,’ which is also in ‘SKINNY,’ which starts the album. So it also ends the album.” \\n\",\n",

It’s not all hip-hop; the ’60s-influenced pop of “You’ll Be Back” and the classical influence of “Take a Break” underline Miranda’s range, and it all adds up to a visionary redefinition of musical theater.'},\n",

       "     'standard': 'The Chicago drill superstar’s eighth studio album, 2023’s <i>Almost Healed</i>, was devoted to the concept of recovering from trauma—a theme that’s haunted Lil Durk’s music, either implicitly or explicitly, since his emergence in the early 2010s as the most melodically gifted of the genre’s rising stars. Its March 2025 follow-up, <i>Deep Thoughts</i>, was slated for release in October 2024. But that same month, Durk was arrested (along with several affiliates of his record label and collective, Only the Family) in connection to a murder-for-hire case against a rival rapper. The rapper born Durk Banks has maintained his innocence, but was denied bail on the grounds of being a flight risk. If convicted of the charges, the 32-year-old faces life in prison.\\n\\nThis changes the gravity of his long-awaited ninth album, which was delayed four times since the 2024 arrest. But the tracklist of <i>Deep Thoughts</i> seems to reflect a different lifetime, with pre-arrest singles like “Turn Up a Notch” and a suite of lusty ballads like the benny blanco-produced Jhene Aiko duet, “Can’t Hide It.” The resounding pathos of Durk’s work remains—most potently on “Keep on Sippin’,” whose candid bars detail the vicious cycle of addiction. But the stakes have changed, and it’s hard not to wonder what the Lil Durk of the past year might have to get off his chest instead. Still, an offhand line from “They Want to Be You,” a melancholy Future collab about the expectations of fame, hits even harder now: “All the kids rap, they wanna be just like you.”',\n",

       "     'standard': 'Scores of Puerto Rican artists have used their music to express love and pride in their island, but few do so with the same purposeful vigor as Bad Bunny. The superstar from Vega Baja is responsible for numerous songs that center his homeland, from unofficial national anthems like “Estamos Bien” and “El Apagón” to powerful posse cuts like “ACHO PR” with veteran reggaetón luminaries Arcángel, De La Ghetto, and Ñengo Flow. More recently, he’s been decidedly direct about his passions and concerns, expressed in vivid detail on 2024’s standalone single “Una Velita.” Positioned as his sixth proper studio album, <i>DeBÍ TiRAR MáS FOToS</i> centers Puerto Rico in his work more so than before, celebrating various musical styles within its legacy. \\n\\nWhile 2023’s <i>nadie sabe lo que va a pasar mañana</i> validated his trapero past with a more modern take on the sound he emerged with in the 2010s, this follow-up largely diverges from hip-hop, demonstrating his apparent aversion to repeating himself from album to album. Instead, house music morphs into plena on “EL CLúB,” the latter genre resurfacing later in splendorous fashion on “CAFé CON RON” with Los Pleneros de la Cresta. Befitting its title, “VOY A LLeVARTE PA PR” is set to a sleek reggaetón rhythm for prime-time perreo vibes, as is also the case for “KETU TeCRÉ” and the relatively more rugged “EoO.” A bold salsa statement, “BAILE INoLVIDABLE” pays apparent homage to some seminal Fania releases by Willie Colón and Héctor Lavoe, with traces of the instrumental interplay of “Juanito Alimaña” and an irresistible coda reminiscent to that of “Periódico de Ayer.” Regardless of style, the political and the personal thematically blur throughout the album, a new year’s gloom hanging over “PIToRRO DE COCO” and a metaphorical wound left open after the poignant “TURISTA.”\\n\\nAs before, Bad Bunny remains an excellent and inventive collaborator, linking here primarily with other Puerto Ricans as more than a mere symbolic gesture. Sociopolitically minded indie group Chuwi join for the eclectic and vibrant “WELTiTA,” its members providing melodic vocals that both complement and magnify those of their host. Carolina natives Dei V and Omar Courtz form a formidable trio for the thumping dancehall retrofuturism of “VeLDÁ,” while RaiNao proves an exceedingly worthy duet partner on “PERFuMITO NUEVO.”',\n",

       "     'standard': 'If there were any remaining doubts as to hip-hop’s MVP, consider the decision stamped: Kendrick Lamar officially won 2024. There were whispers that Compton’s finest was working on an album in the wake of his feud with Drake, a once-in-a-generation beef that kept jaws dropped for months. (Perhaps you’ve heard of a little song called “Not Like Us,” an immediate entry into the canon of all-time great diss tracks.) After a sold-out celebration at the Kia Forum, an armful of Grammy nods and streaming records, and the headlining slot at next year’s Super Bowl, Lamar ties up his biggest year yet with a bow with his sixth album, <i>GNX</i>, the most legitimately surprising surprise drop since <i>BEYONCÉ</i> in 2013.\\n\\nNamed for his beloved classic Buick, <i>GNX</i> finds Kendrick wielding a hatchet he’s by no means ready to bury, still channeling this summer’s cranked-to-11 energy. On “wacced out murals,” he’s riding around listening to Anita Baker, plotting on several downfalls: “It used to be fuck that n***a, but now it’s plural/Fuck everybody, that’s on my body.” (Yes, there’s a nod to his Super Bowl drama with Lil Wayne.) If you’ve been holding your breath for Jack Antonoff to link with Mustard, wait no more—the seemingly odd couple share production credits on multiple tracks, the explosive “tv off” among them.\\n\\nStill, K.Dot keeps you guessing: It’s not quite 12 tracks of straight venom over world-conquering West Coast beats. SZA helps cool things down on the Luther Vandross-sampling “luther,” while Lamar snatches back a borrowed title on “heart pt. 6” to remember the early days of TDE: “Grinding with my brothers, it was us against them, no one above us/Bless our hearts.” He cycles through past lives over a flip of 2Pac’s “Made N****z” on “reincarnated” before getting real with his father about war, peace, addiction, and ego death, and on “man at the garden,” he outlines his qualifications for the position of GOAT. Here’s another bullet point to add to that CV: On <i>GNX</i>, Lamar still surprises while giving the people exactly what they want.\\n',\n",

       "     'standard': 'Playboi Carti has hardly been absent in the roughly four years since <i>Whole Lotta Red</i>, appearing alongside the likes of Future, Latto, and Trippie Redd in the interim. Still, that didn’t keep his enormous fanbase from persistently clamoring over the prospect of <i>I AM MUSIC</i>, ultimately released with the truncated title of, simply, <i>MUSIC</i>. Its substantial length seems to acknowledge the wait, opening with a flurry of rage-rap tracks like “POP OUT” and “CRUSH” that herald the raconteur’s welcome arrival. Over its 30-track, 77-minute runtime, his sonics shift between the aggressively blown-out, synth-heavy post-trap he became infamous for and something markedly poppier, yet all of it undeniably within his stylistic range. \\n\\nCarti initially kept his choice of guests close to the vest, as has become custom for high-profile album drops. Yet it would be impossible not to recognize Kendrick Lamar spitting on “GOOD CREDIT,” Future emoting over “TRIM,” or collaborative career mainstay Lil Uzi Vert gliding triumphantly through “TWIN TRIM.” The Weeknd’s prominent feature on “RATHER LIE” makes for perhaps the most overt example of his envelope-pushing here, though appearances by Travis Scott on “PHILLY” and the tag team of Young Thug and Ty Dolla $ign on “WE NEED ALL DA VIBES” make the pivot even more plausible.\\n\\nEven with friends like these, Carti shines brighter on his own, his breathy near-falsetto vocal booming through the escalating video game arpeggios of “I SEEEEEE YOU BABY BOI” and his raspy snarl swerving around the cinematic noise of “COCAINE NOSE.” Not exclusively looking towards the future, there’s an almost nostalgic appreciation for Atlanta’s early 2010s sound evoked on “RADAR,” its beat reminiscent of classic 1017 Brick Squad tapes.\\n',\n",

       "     'standard': \"The 2025 reworking of Ariana Grande’s lightly conceptual seventh album appends six tracks to its predecessor—and, perhaps crucially, a notable do-over. “intro (end of the world) [extended],” the first of the new cuts, starts simply enough as a reprise of the existential lullaby that opens the original album. But its longing is cut off at the knees when Grande begins describing her desire to “jump into your skin and change your eyes” so she can provide a kind of turbo-charged empathy that reveals the relationship’s darker side. While its pillow-soft sonics and Grande’s resolute singing are gentle, it’s still a jarring lyric to hear right after the album proper’s closer, “ordinary things,” on which Grande's nonna Marjorie tells her granddaughter in no uncertain terms about the signals that a relationship is over. Nonna spoke, Grande listened, that book is closed.\\n\\nOr is there even a book in the first place? When discussing the beat-forward, hit-packed <i>eternal sunshine</i> with Apple Music’s Zane Lowe around its initial release in 2024, Grande said, “Finding a home in <i>eternal sunshine</i> was a lovely costume to wear,” noting that the “freedom within art” was present because of the endless possibilities for sources—personal truths, films (like <i>Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind</i>, the surrealistic love story  that provides the album’s title), high concepts. With the release of <i>Wicked</i>, Ariana's big-screen coming-out party in late 2024, Grande had reached new heights of celebrity—and with that newfound status, her personal life was under further scrutiny.\\n\\nOver the rest of <i>brighter days ahead</i>, Grande is playfully opaque, making a reference to “holding space” on the simmering “warm,” which turns Grande’s vocals into a neon-lit cloud settling over glossy synth skyscrapers, and declaring “I’m still the same but only entirely different” on “Hampstead,” a reimagining of the barroom-piano-led last-call lament. That’s only one spot where Grande’s voice pushes into exciting new territory: “dandelion,” a lusty expression of desire, spins out of a drowsy trumpet line, its looped horn and sampled trap drums adding heat.\\n\\n“Might fuck around and elevate my expectations,” Ariana muses on the chorus of “past life,” a low-lit synth-R&B cut. As with her other releases, <i>brighter days ahead</i> shows how her attention to detail and desire to evolve have resulted in a singular body of work that, even if it’s playing coy about where the public Grande ends and the private Ari begins, is utterly her own.\",\n",

Herbo knows that influence is nice, but attribution is better. On <i>Greatest Rapper Alive</i>, he tries to cash in that goodwill for a different sort of accolade.

       "     'standard': 'Canadian multi-hyphenate Tate McRae has barely stopped to take a breath since kindergarten: The 21-year-old began intensive dance training at age six, scored a record deal at 16, and tied for top nominee for the 2025 JUNO Awards. Her third studio album arrives just a few months after the end of her 2024 world tour in support of her sophomore album, 2023’s <i>THINK LATER</i>. “Being on tour for a year feels like a million years—you’re like, ‘Holy shit, I have been gone for a lifetime,’” McRae tells Apple Music, though naturally she used the time as a learning opportunity. “Being onstage every night and analyzing yourself that much, you become uber-aware of yourself and what’s going on.” She began paying closer attention to exactly what kind of songs inspired her to move, what beats triggered her dancers to get—in a word—“nasty.”\\n\\n<i>So Close to What</i> is not exactly a club record—more like a pop record you can viscerally feel, conducive to the kind of choreo that makes a killer stage show. Prominent on McRae’s mood board were Timbaland and The Neptunes, whose kinetic productions made the aughts feel like the future. Echoes of sparkly, club-friendly 2000s R&B abound: “bloodonmyhands” recruits Flo Milli for a Miami bass throwback, while “Purple lace bra” lands somewhere between The-Dream’s <i>Love vs. Money</i> and Lana Del Rey’s <i>Born to Die</i> (which checks out, given the latter album’s producer, Emile Haynie, among the credits). And on “Sports car,” McRae and co-writer Julia Michaels found unlikely inspiration in a 2005 crunk classic. “[Michaels] had been dying to reference the Ying Yang Twins’ ‘The Whisper Song,’ and I was like, ‘That’s crazy,’” she says. Sure enough, the concept worked.\\n\\nThe secret to writing her most grown-up album to date, as McRae explains, was a writer’s room that skewed heavily towards women (including Michaels and songwriter Amy Allen). “With music and finding perspective on situations, no one quite understands like another girl,” McRae explains. “You need another girl to know exactly what we’ve gone through and to know what it actually feels like in order to write a song. When you’re in a writing session, you have to be one brain together, and if it’s not that, that’s when chaos happens,” she went on. “It is so liberating to be with other girls and talk about things that are so frustrating and then feel so satisfied and accomplished after.”',\n",

       "    'editorialNotes': {'tagline': 'New Album and Interview',\n",
       "     'standard': '“That is who Lady Gaga is to me,” Lady Gaga tells Apple Music’s Zane Lowe of creating <i>MAYHEM</i>. “Maybe to someone else, it might be the Meat Dress or something that I did that they remember as me. But for me, I always want to be remembered for being a real artist and someone that cares so much.” In that vein, Gaga set out to make her latest album—which she calls her “favorite record in a long time”—its own thing. “<i>ARTPOP</i> was a vibe. <i>Joanne</i> was a sound. <i>Chromatica</i> had a sound. All different. <i>The Fame Monster</i> was more chaotic. <i>The Fame</i> was theatrical pop. <i>Born This Way</i>, to me, had more of a metal/electro New York vibe to it,” she says. “I actually made the effort making <i>MAYHEM</i> to not do that and not try to give my music an outfit, but instead to allow myself to be influenced by everything.”\\n\\nIndeed, <i>MAYHEM</i> traverses—and oftentimes melds—the various flavors of Mother Monster’s career, from the disco scene of her earliest work to her singer-songwriter era and back again. The opening tracks, singles “Disease” and “Abracadabra,” revisit dance-floor Gaga to thrilling fanfare. The spirited “Garden of Eden” follows the trend of what she calls “2000 throwbacks.” With its sparkly synths, “LoveDrug” might be seen as the brighter and shinier elder sibling of her early cut “LoveGame.” She even specifically admits the “electro-grunge influence” seeps its way in—especially apparent in “Perfect Celebrity,” “Vanish into You,” and “The Beast.” The latter even shows shades of <i>Joanne</i>, but “Blade of Grass” and her Bruno Mars duet “Die with a Smile” really put her former folk-pop-rock persona on display.\\n\\nIt’s also all incredibly personal to her. “The album is a series of gothic dreams,” she says. “I say it’s like images of the past that haunt me, and they somehow find their way into who I am today.” Below, Gaga takes us through several tracks (all in Spatial Audio), in her own words.\\n\\n<b>“Abracadabra”</b>\\n“I think I didn’t want to make this kind of music for a long time, even though I had it in me. And I think ‘Abracadabra’ is very much my sound—something that I honed in [on] after many years, and I wanted to do it again. I felt like being stagnant was just death in my artistry. And I just really wanted to constantly be a student. Not just reinvent myself, but learn something new with every record. And that wasn’t always what people wanted from me, but that’s what I wanted from me. And it’s the thing that I’m the most probably proud of, if I look back on my career, is I know how much I grew from record to record and how authentic it all was. The thing that was most important to me was being a student of music, above everything else.”\\n\\n<b>“Perfect Celebrity”</b>\\n“It’s super angry: ‘I’ve become a notorious being/Find my clone, she’s asleep on the ceiling.’ It’s almost comical, this idea that any time I’m in the room with anyone, there’s me—Stefani—and Lady Gaga asleep on the ceiling, and I have to figure out which body to be in. It’s kind of intense, but that song, that was an important song on this album because it didn’t feel honest to me on <i>MAYHEM</i> to exclude something that had that kind of anger in it because then it felt like I was trying to be a good girl or whatever and be something that I’m not actually. Part of my personal mayhem is that I have joy and celebration, but I’m also sometimes angry or super sad or really celebratory or completely insecure and have no confidence.”\\n\\n<b>“Shadow of a Man”</b>\\n“That song is so much a response to my career and what it always felt like to be the only girl in the room a lot of the time. And to always be standing in the shadow of a man because there were so many around me that I learned how to dance in that shadow.”\\n\\n<b>“The Beast”</b>\\n“In that record, it is me or someone singing to their lover who’s a werewolf, but what I believe about this is, this record is also about [my fiancé] Michael [Polansky] and I, and that this song is also about me and being Lady Gaga. What the beast is, who I become when I’m onstage, and who I am when I make my art and the prechorus of that song is, ‘You can’t hide who you are. 11:59, your heart’s racing, you’re growling, and we both know why.’ It’s like somebody that is saying to the beast, ‘I know you’re a monster, but I can handle you, and I love you.’”\\n\\n<b>“Blade of Grass”</b>\\n“Michael asked me how I would want him to propose to me one day. We were in our backyard, and I said, ‘Just take a blade of grass and wrap it around my finger,’ and then I wrote ‘Blade of Grass’ because I remembered the way his face looked, and I remembered the grass in the backyard, and I remember thinking he should use that really long grass that’s in the center of the backyard. Those moments, to me, at a certain point I was into the idea of fame and artifice and being the conductor of your own life when it came to your own inner sense of fame. I had to fight a lot harder to make music and dance a little bit later into my career because my life became so different that I didn’t have as much life around me to inspire me.”',\n",

Since he found sobriety after time off from music in the early 2020s, Felker and his redemption arc have influenced and inspired a number of today’s biggest and brightest country up-and-comers, including Zach Bryan, who wrote a song, 2019’s “Felker,” about the enigmatic musician and references the band in fan favorite “East Side of Sorrow.” \\n\\nThat this follow-up to 2023’s <i>A Cat in the Rain</i> arrives after just two years is a welcome development given the drought of new Turnpike music between 2017 and 2023, and the relatively short period between LPs also, fortunately, does not point to hasty writing or half-assed recording. Instead, Felker and company sound invigorated as ever, with producer Shooter Jennings returning to lend his light but capable touch to 11 new tunes. <i>The Price of Admission</i> opens with “On the Red River,” a vivid and contemplative co-write with Old Crow Medicine Show lead singer Ketch Secor. John Fulbright lends his pen to “Searching for a Light,” a fiddle-heavy exploration of redemption. Other highlights include “Be Here,” an old-timey jaunt complete with gang vocals, and “Leaving Town (Woody Guthrie Festival),” a road song with a heavy dose of reflection.\\n',\n",

       "     'standard': \"Justin Vernon has never been shy about bearing the weight of his instantly mythical origin story and his fast, unlikely trajectory into global stardom. Four albums and 18 years after <i>For Emma, Forever Ago</i>, <i>SABLE, fABLE</i> is a document of finding peace—joy, even—and a testament to the work it’s taken to get there. “This record, as much as that first record, if not more, was really just a keystone for healing and growing away from this time period where I felt trapped,” he tells Apple Music’s Zane Lowe. Once COVID wiped out the tour plans for 2019’s <i>i,i</i>, Vernon, like pretty much everyone, used the time to take stock, and he came to understand, among other things, that touring might not be the healthiest thing for him. So he made songs.\\n\\n“It really was like, ‘Okay, I’m not well and I won't make it if I don't do something to change this pretty drastically and stop the whole touring engine,” Vernon says. “There was a sense of relief and an incredible grief to say goodbye to the team that we built. I was like, ‘Let me just get these songs done and just sneak them out there so I can just get them off my chest,’ because that’s what I really needed: to finish them, to learn what was inside them.” The first of these songs, written at the beginning of lockdown, “THINGS BEHIND THINGS BEHIND THINGS” is a snapshot of that lonely, uncertain time, but it feels bigger and more hopeful than that to Vernon with five years of hindsight. “In the short term, it makes you feel better, but it’s also a way to lean into your grief and lean into your pain and lean into your guilt,” he says. “I think eventually when I hear that song now, I feel clean from everything that I was dealing with when I had to write it and after I wrote it. But it takes years for things to take shape and for internal things to budge.”\\n\\nFrom there, the album begins to let more light in with songs like the evidently more hopeful “Everything Is Peaceful Love” (“It’s just all about celebrating this moment right here and just sort of trying to express that heart-leaping-out-of-your-chest feeling”) and “If Only I Could Wait,” featuring vocals from Danielle Haim of HAIM, which Vernon considers nothing less than his favorite American rock band. The album splits the difference between the immediacy of <i>For Emma</i> and the often inscrutable maximalism of <i>22, A Million</i> and <i>i,i</i>. It was during the album’s long gestation that Vernon’s profile was boosted by his work with Taylor Swift, even as his own project remained in the shadows, Vernon exercising a patience and restraint and creating a healthier perspective that was nothing less than career-saving, if not life-saving. \\n\\n“We are insanely beautiful creatures,” he says. “And so I think where I’ve got to with the simplicity of this music, it was just like, I just want to give it to you. I just want to have it be my version of Bob Seger’s ‘Against the Wind’—just boom, here it is. We’re not going to hide, we’re not going to put it behind any drapery. We’re going to just give it to you as much as humanly possible.”\\n\",\n",

       "     'standard': 'The fourth album from Selena Gomez—the 32-year-old multi-hyphenate who needs no introduction, having been famous for approximately two-thirds of her life—doubles as her first album with her fiancé, benny blanco, who has produced and written more hit singles than you’ve had hot dinners. (It’s blanco’s third album, following 2018’s feature-happy <i>Friends Keep Secrets</i> and its 2021 sequel.) The 14-track collaboration, which the pair announced shortly after their late-2024 engagement, seemed to come together much like their relationship—comfortably, without being planned or forced. “This was just an idea that started in our bedroom—like, ‘Let’s just make something fun,’” blanco tells Apple Music’s Zane Lowe, describing the ease with which the songs unfolded, often collaborating with songwriters (Julia Michaels, Justin Tranter) whose relationships with both Gomez and blanco went back years. “Everything felt right. It almost felt too good.”\\n\\nWritten and recorded mostly at blanco’s house, <i>I Said I Love You First</i> shows the power couple’s love story through a wide-angle lens, zooming out to include past heartbreaks, mistakes, and self-doubts. On “Younger and Hotter Than Me,” Gomez strikes a Lana-esque chord between vulnerable and withering, sniping gently at an old fling: “We’re not getting any younger/But your girlfriends seem to.” Meanwhile, blanco sets the tone at “dynamically moody” with ’80s synth-pop beats ideal for crying on the dance floor, or for highlighting Gomez’s legacy as one of modern pop’s iconic Sad Girls. Here, she sings in Spanish on the slow-burning “Ojos Tristes,” leaves ill-considered voicemails with Gracie Abrams on “Call Me When You Break Up,” and pulls off a respectfully bratty Charli xcx impression on “Bluest Flame.” Potential sappiness is countered by tongue-in-cheek humor: On the entendre-heavy “Sunset Blvd,” the couple embrace naked on a Hollywood street while concerned bystanders call the police. “This whole experience has been cathartic and beautiful,” Gomez says. “And I got to do it with my best friend.”',\n",

       "     'standard': 'In the 18 months after Taylor Swift released <i>Midnights</i>, it often felt as though the universe had fully opened up to her. The Eras Tour was breaking records and blowing past the billion-dollar mark; its attendant concert film became the highest-grossing of all time. She generated interest and commerce and headlines everywhere she stepped foot, from tour stops to the tunnels of NFL stadiums. In 2023, she was named both <i>TIME</i> magazine’s Person of the Year and—just as iconic, tbh—Apple Music’s Artist of the Year. \\n\\nBut do songs about that level of success speak to you? As the news broke that her highly private six-year relationship to Joe Alwyn had ended, Swifties started Swiftie-ing, quickly recirculating a clip on social media of Swift a few weeks earlier, onstage during an early Eras show, in tears as she sang “champagne problems”—a song she and Alwyn had written together. It was a reminder that, despite the superhero-like aura she now radiates, Swift, at her peak, still hurts like the rest of us. What sets her apart is her ability to sublimate that pain into pop. When she announced her 11th studio album in early 2024—while accepting another Grammy, as one does—we probably shouldn’t have been surprised. \\n\\n“I needed to make it,” she’d say of <i>THE TORTURED POETS DEPARTMENT</i> a few weeks later, to a crowd of—[rubs eyes]—96,000 in Melbourne, Australia. “I’ve never had an album where I’ve needed songwriting more than I needed it on <i>TORTURED POETS</i>.” Working again with trusted collaborators Jack Antonoff and Aaron Dessner, she returns to the soft, comfortable, bed-like sonics of <i>Midnights</i>. But the stakes feel noticeably higher here: This isn’t so much a breakup album as it is a deep-sea exploration of everything Swift has been feeling, a plunge through emotional debris. \\n\\nOn “But Daddy I Love Him”—over strings and guitar that faintly recall her country roots—she lashes out at the crush of scrutiny and expectation she’s been subject to from the start. Naturally, catharsis comes after the chorus: “I’ll tell you something right now,” she sings. “I’d rather burn my whole life down than listen to one more second of all this bitching and moaning.” On “Florida!!!” she and Florence + the Machine team up for a pulpy escape fantasy wherein they Thelma and Louise their way down to the Sunshine State in hopes of starting over with new lives and identities: “Love left me like this,” they sing. “And I don’t want to exist.”\\n\\nAt turns hilarious and heartbreaking, <i>TTPD</i> is a study in extremes, Swift leaning into heightened emotions with heightened, hyperbolic, ALL-CAPS language and imagery—how we think when we’re drunk on love or flattened by its sudden disappearance. Note the dark humor she weaves through the Post Malone-enriched opener “Fortnight” (“Your wife waters flowers/I wanna kill her”). Or the thrilling self-deprecation of “Down Bad,” a foray into science fiction wherein Swift likens the warmth of a relationship to being abducted by love-bombing extraterrestrials—only to be left “naked and alone, in a field in my same old town.” \\n\\nBut this remains her most candid and unsparing work to date: As a listener, you frequently get the feeling that you’ve stumbled across emails she’d written but never sent, or into conversations you were never meant to hear. There’s a density and a specificity and a ferocity to her lyrical work here that makes 2012’s “All Too Well” feel sorta light by comparison. If you’re the kind of Swiftie who likes to live in the details, well, this one might be your Super Bowl. “You swore that you loved me, but where were the clues?” she asks on the devastating “So Long, London,” a high point. “I died on the altar waiting for the proof.” Alone at a piano on the haunting “loml,” she flips the script on someone who’d told her she was the love of their life, by telling them that they were the loss of hers: “I’ll still see it until I die.” \\n\\nThe story, as you likely know, doesn’t end there. We get a glimpse of new beginnings in “The Alchemy” (“This happens once every few lifetimes/These chemicals hit me like white wine”) and something like triumph in the montage-ready synths of “I Can Do It With a Broken Heart,” when Swift, shattered on the floor, “as the crowd was chanting, ‘More!’,” still finds the strength to deliver: “’Cause I’m a real tough kid and I can handle my shit.” \\n\\nBut we also get a sense of acceptance, of newfound perspective. On “Clara Bow”—named after a 1920s movie star who was able to survive the jump from silent film to sound—Swift reflects on the journey of a small-town girl made good, sung from the vantage of an industry obsessed with the next big thing. She zooms out and out and out until, in the album’s closing seconds, she’s singing about herself in the third person, in past tense, acknowledging that nothing is forever. “You look like Taylor Swift in this light, we’re loving it,” she sings. “You’ve got edge she never did/The future’s bright, dazzling.”\\n',\n",

       "     'standard': 'Prior to his poppy pivot on last year’s oft personal <i>Sol María</i>, Eladio Carrión thrived as a trapero. A run of mixtape-style projects like 2020’s <i>Sauce Boyz</i> and two feature-free <i>SEN2 KBRN</i> installments advanced the Puerto Rican rapper’s career from underground stardom to a pivotal part of a contemporary vanguard. That peaked in 2023 with the release of <i>3MEN2 KBRN</i>, a bold and boastful album that paired the bilingual artist with Future, 50 Cent, and Quavo without losing his foothold in Latin hip-hop. That uncompromising spirit and deep love for rap music persists on <i>DON KBRN</i>, less a return-to-form post-<i>Sol María</i> than a full-throated statement of dedication to the proverbial culture.\\n\\nAs a lyricist, Carrión has reached a stage in his rap craft that surpasses both peers and veterans alike. This quickly becomes clear after the brief yet potent intro “Invencible” gives way to the stunning “Ohtani,” the first of several solo moments where his powers rightfully surge under the spotlight. With its Hypnotize Minds flair and references to everything from Samuel L. Jackson’s <i>Snakes on a Plane</i> to star running back Saquon Barkley, “H.I.M.” succinctly sums up his highly stylized braggadocio. It certainly doesn’t hurt that he continues to work with great producers who’ve grown with him, the Foreign Teck tags on cuts like “AMG” and “Piedras en la ventana” feeling like a victory for the whole team.\\n\\nCarrión’s guest list is nothing short of a flex in and of itself, freely crossing borders via jet-setting collaborations with North American hitmakers like Big Sean and Jessie Reyez as well as respected Latin artists including Neutro Shorty, Quevedo, and Young Miko. A hospitably inclusive host, he brings música mexicana powerhouse Peso Pluma into the trap space on the brassy “Tiffany” and taps breakout Chilean upstart Cris MJ for the perreo thump of “El Reggaeton del Disco.” Still, when he locks in with the like-minded Myke Towers for the explosive “Vetements,” the fan-friendly team-up’s bars will leave more than a few jaws on the floor. And while the focus is almost exclusively centered on the global rap world, he finds room here for his relatively newfound pop appeal, notably on the duet “Me Muero” with Barcelona’s versatile Lia Kali.',\n",

       "     'standard': 'Kevin Gates dropped <i>I’m Him</i> some five years after “I Don’t Get Tired,” the breakout hit that transformed him from mixtape upstart to mainstream rap rule-breaker. Beyond the controversies and improprieties that added a tabloid-ready gloss to his career, the Baton Rouge artist stood out on that second proper album for his inventive, oft-energetic takes on the trap era’s street-hustle mindset. Now, another half-decade later, freshly independent and pushing 40, he reveals both the rewards and the toll of that lifestyle on this concise sequel. \\n\\nIn line with hip-hop’s ongoing mental health journey in rhyme, opener “Therapy Sessions” dives deep into a psyche so fraught with trauma that it would send most so-called pain rappers into hiding. “Same Way” finds him operating as a master of that particular subgenre, calculating loss amid the wins as a form of cautionary tale for the listener. Via the duality of “Big Bruddah (Don’t Be Mad),” he recounts betrayals and slights endured in the trenches while also flaunting his wealth and the intricate means through which he’s acquired it. Still, he can’t help but come off as triumphant on “Brasi the Eagle,” evoking his infamous mobster moniker to emphasize that his successes surpass his suffering.\\n\\nGates’ characteristically unfiltered approach serves him well here. Whether truth-telling on the grimy motivational “Manifest” or casually pulling the baddest of baddies on the explicit “No Pressure,” that outlandish streak resurfaces enough times that it rewards his day-one listenership. Those long-term fans know that he’s remained true to form all these years, though anyone needing a reminder can reference “Block Away” and “Kiss the Ring” for clarity.',\n",

       "    'artistName': 'Billie Eilish',\n",
       "    'editorialNotes': {'tagline': 'New Album',\n",
       "     'standard': \"Billie Eilish has always delighted in subverting expectations, but <i>HIT ME HARD AND SOFT</i> still, somehow, lands like a meteor. “This is the most ‘me’ thing I’ve ever made,” she tells Apple Music’s Zane Lowe. “And purely me—not a character.” An especially wide-ranging and transportive project, even for her, it’s brimming with the guts and theatricality of an artist who has the world at her feet—and knows it. In a tight 45 minutes, Eilish does as she promises and hits listeners with a mix of scorching send-ups, trance excursions, and a stomping tribute to queer pleasure, alongside more soft-edged cuts like teary breakup ballads and jaunts into lounge-y jazz. But the project never feels zigzaggy thanks to, well, the Billie Eilish of it all: her glassy vocals, her knowing lyrics, her unique ability to make softness sound so huge. \\n\\n<i>HIT ME</i> is Eilish’s third album and, like the two previous ones, was recorded with her brother and longtime creative partner FINNEAS. In conceptualizing it, the award-winning songwriting duo were intent on creating the sort of album that makes listeners feel like they’ve been dropped into an alternate universe. As it happens, this universe has several of the same hallmarks as the one she famously drew up on her history-making debut, 2019’s <i>WHEN WE ALL FALL ASLEEP, WHERE DO WE GO?</i>. In many ways, this project feels more like that album’s sequel than 2021’s jazzy <i>Happier Than Ever</i>, which Eilish has said was recorded during a confusing, depressive pandemic haze. In the three years since, she has tried to return to herself—to go outside, hang out with friends, and talk more openly about sex and identity, all things that make her feel authentic and, for lack of a better word, normal. \\n\\n“As much as <i>Happier Than Ever</i> was coming from this place of, like, 'We're so good. This sounds so good,' it was also not knowing at all who I was,’” she tells Apple Music. FINNEAS agrees, calling it their “identity crisis album.” But <I>HIT ME HARD AND SOFT</I> is, she says, the reverse. “The whole time we were making it, we were like, 'I don't know if I'm making anything good, this might be terrible…’ But now I'm like, 'Yeah, but I'm comfortable in who I am now.' I feel like I know who I am now.” \\n\\nAs a songwriter, Eilish is still in touch with her vulnerabilities, but at 22, with a garage full of Grammys and Oscars, they aren’t as heavy. These days it’s heartache, not her own insecurities, that keeps her up at night, and the songs are juicier for it. “LUNCH,” a racy, bass-heavy banger that can’t help but hog the spotlight, finds Eilish crushing so hard on a woman that she compares the hook-up to a meal. “I’ve said it all before, but I’ll say it again/I’m interested in more than just being your friend,” she sings. The lyrics are so much more than lewd flirtations. They’re also a way of stepping back into the spotlight—older, wiser, more fully herself. Read below as Eilish and FINNEAS share the inside story behind a few standout songs. \\n\\n<b>“LUNCH”</b>\\nBILLIE: “One of the verses was written after a conversation I had with a friend and they were telling me about this complete animal magnetism they were feeling. And I was like, ‘Ooh, I'm going to pretend to be them for a second and just write...and I’m gonna throw some jokes in there.’ We took ourselves a little too seriously on <i>Happier Than Ever</i>. When you start to embrace cringe, you're so much happier. You have so much more fun.” \\n\\n<b>“BIRDS OF A FEATHER”</b> \\nBILLIE: “This song has that ending where I just keep going—it’s the highest I've ever belted in my life. I was alone in the dark, thinking, ‘You know what? I'm going to try something.’ And I literally just kept going higher and higher. This is a girl who could not belt until I was literally 18. I couldn't physically do it. So I'm so proud of that. I remember coming home and being like, ‘Mom! Listen!’” \\n\\n<b>“WILDFLOWER”</b> \\nBILLIE: “To me, [the message here is] I'm not asking for reassurance. I am 100% confident that you love me. That's not the problem. The problem is this thing that I can't shake. It’s a girl code song. It's about breaking girl code, which is one of the most challenging places. And it isn’t about cheating. It isn’t about anything even bad. It was just something I couldn’t get out of my head. And in some ways, this song helped me understand what I was feeling, like, ‘Oh, maybe this is actually affecting me more than I thought.’ I love this song for so many reasons. It's so tortured and overthinky.” \\n\\n<b>“THE GREATEST”</b>\\nBILLIE: “To us, this is the heart of the album. It completes the whole thing. Making it was sort of a turning point. Everything went pretty well after that. It kind of woke us back up.” \\nFINNEAS: “When you realize you're willing to go somewhere that someone else isn't, it's so devastating. And everybody has been in some dynamic in their life or their relationship like that. When you realize that you'd sacrifice and wear yourself out and compromise all these things, but the person you're in love with won’t make those sacrifices, or isn’t in that area? To me, that's what that song is about. It's like, you don't even want to know how lonely this is.” \\n\\n<b>“L’AMOUR DE MA VIE”</b>\\nFINNEAS: “The album is all about Billie. It's not a narrative album about a fictional character. But we have always loved songs within songs within songs. Here, you've just listened to Billie sound so heartbroken in ‘THE GREATEST,’ and then she sings this song that's like the antibody to that. It’s like, ‘You know what? Fuck you anyway.’ And then she goes to the club.” \\n\\n<b>“BLUE”</b>\\n“The first quarter of ‘BLUE’ is a song Finneas and I made when I was 14 called ‘True Blue.’ We played it at little clubs before I had anything out, and never [released it] because we aged out of it. Years went by. Then, for a time, the second album was going to include one additional song called ‘Born Blue.’ It was totally different, and it didn’t make the cut. We never thought about it again. Then, in 2022, I was doing my laundry and found out ‘True Blue’ had been leaked. At first I was like ‘Oh god, they fucking stole my shit again,’ but then I couldn't stop listening. I went on YouTube and typed ‘Billie Eilish True Blue’ to find all the rips of it, because I didn't even have the original. Then it hit us, like, ‘Ooh, you know what'd be cool? What if we took both of these old songs, resurrected them, and made them into one?’ The string motif is the melody from the bridge of ‘THE GREATEST,’ which is also in ‘SKINNY,’ which starts the album. So it also ends the album.” \\n\",\n",

       "   'standard': 'The Chicago drill superstar’s eighth studio album, 2023’s <i>Almost Healed</i>, was devoted to the concept of recovering from trauma—a theme that’s haunted Lil Durk’s music, either implicitly or explicitly, since his emergence in the early 2010s as the most melodically gifted of the genre’s rising stars. Its March 2025 follow-up, <i>Deep Thoughts</i>, was slated for release in October 2024. But that same month, Durk was arrested (along with several affiliates of his record label and collective, Only the Family) in connection to a murder-for-hire case against a rival rapper. The rapper born Durk Banks has maintained his innocence, but was denied bail on the grounds of being a flight risk. If convicted of the charges, the 32-year-old faces life in prison.\\n\\nThis changes the gravity of his long-awaited ninth album, which was delayed four times since the 2024 arrest. But the tracklist of <i>Deep Thoughts</i> seems to reflect a different lifetime, with pre-arrest singles like “Turn Up a Notch” and a suite of lusty ballads like the benny blanco-produced Jhene Aiko duet, “Can’t Hide It.” The resounding pathos of Durk’s work remains—most potently on “Keep on Sippin’,” whose candid bars detail the vicious cycle of addiction. But the stakes have changed, and it’s hard not to wonder what the Lil Durk of the past year might have to get off his chest instead. Still, an offhand line from “They Want to Be You,” a melancholy Future collab about the expectations of fame, hits even harder now: “All the kids rap, they wanna be just like you.”',\n",
